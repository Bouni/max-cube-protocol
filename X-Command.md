## The 'x:' command

The 'x:' command sends a break to the command before e.g. using the 'n' command. 
The cube acknowledges the the processing with the response message from the command before.  

Have al look to the 'n:' command where I discribed this behavior in the section 'Important'.


```
x:
the response message is the message from the command before 
```
